            For this game, we are interested in how university students make decisions about charitable donations.
            You will be given {{Constants.endowment}} with which to play.
        {% formfield player.charity_group %}
        </br>
        You can donate any amount up to {{Constants.endowment}}, including zero. We emphasize that whatever money you donate will
        actually be given to your chosen organization.
        </br></br>
        Any money you do not donate will become part of your earnings for this game.
        For example, if you donate {{Constants.sample_donation}}, your will receive {{Constants.endowment|c}} â€“ {{Constants.sample_donation|c }} = {{Constants.sample_earning}} in earnings for this game.
