        You have now responded to the first series of questions.</br>
        The purpose now is to see how you guess in situations marked by randomness.</br>
        You will play {{Constants.num_rounds}} rounds of a dice game in which you can win money in each round.</br>

        You have to guess what the die will show. The more die rolls you guess correctly, the more money you
        will win. You will receive guaranteed participation fee of {{Constants.participation_fee}}.
