        Imagine a dice roll and guess a number of dots from {{Constants.min_allowed_guess}}
        to {{Constants.max_allowed_guess}}.</br>
        Report the number of dots which you have guessed and then click to the
        next screen.</br>
        Hereafter a die will roll and outcome will be shown. If your guess matched
        the number of dots on the die then you will win {{Constants.win}}, else you will win {{Constants.lose}}.</br>

        You have to guess a number of dots from {{Constants.min_allowed_guess}}
        to {{Constants.max_allowed_guess}}. When you have made your guess you can press the Next button</br>
        Hereafter a die will roll and you will be asked to report the number of dots which you have guessed earlier.</br>
        If your guess matched the number of dots on the die then you will win {{Constants.win}}, else you will win {{Constants.lose}}.</br>

        You should avoid using the back button during the game as it might delete your total winnings.
