            The information on this consent form is provided so that you can decide whether you wish to participate in
            an experiment at the Behavioral and Experimental Economics Lab at Nazarbayev University.
            The study involves web-based behavioral experimental games designed to understand decision-making.
            Participation in the study typically takes 60 minutes and is strictly confidential and no identity-based
            information will be used or stored. The study will not create any risks for the participants or anyone
            associates with them. It is important that you understand that your participation is considered voluntary.
            This means that even if you agree to participate, you are free to withdraw from the experiment at any time.</br>

            Participants begin by answering a series of survey questions, after which they play multiple rounds of
            experimental games. Namely, the Dice task game involves predicting the outcome of a dice roll and public
            good game which involves sharing a hypothetical amount among multiple players. You will receive a flat
            remuneration of 2000 KZ Tenge and an additional amount based on your performance in the experiment only
            after finishing the experiment.</br>
